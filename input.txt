In this example, we first open the input .txt file in read mode ("r") and the output .csv file in write mode ("w"). We create a CSV writer object using the csv.writer() function, passing the output file object. Then, we read each line from the input .txt file, parse the data by splitting on commas (assuming comma-separated values in the .txt file), and write the data to the .csv file using the writerow() method of the CSV writer object. Finally, we close both the input and output files.
