In Python, Polymorphism lets us define methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class. 
In inheritance, the child class inherits the methods from the parent class.

What is Polymorphism: The word polymorphism means having many forms. In programming, polymorphism means the same function name (but different signatures) being used for different types

Types of Polymorphism are: 
     Compile-time polymorphism (Method overloading)
    Run-time polymorphism (Method Overriding)
